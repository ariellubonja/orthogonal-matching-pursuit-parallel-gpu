# EFFICIENT BATCHED CPU/GPU IMPLEMENTATION OF ORTHOGONAL MATCHINGPURSUIT FOR PYTHON
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, implemented using BLAS (CPU) and PyTorch (GPU).

Our implementations vastly outperform those in Scikit-Learn, with the PyTorch version on GPU being over 100 times faster.

A demo along with the implementation can be found in [this Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BwqjGQC5XfaRiTUxit-afW0vg6ezjsh5?usp=sharing).
